Examples
Here's a simple example of how to use this library to parse a JSON file and access its elements in your C code:

c
Copy code
#include "json.h"

int main() {
    Element root_element;
    const char *filename = "example.json";

    if (read_json(filename, &root_element)) {
        // JSON parsing successful
        // Access and manipulate JSON elements using the 'root_element' object
        // For example:
        // Element *value = get_element(root_element.as_object, "key");
        // Access the value as value->as_int or value->as_string, etc.
    } else {
        // JSON parsing failed
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse JSON from %s\n", filename);
    }

    return 0;
}
